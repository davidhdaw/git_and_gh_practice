I had a really nice trip to Japan 3 or 4 years ago where we went to this place called [Naoshima](https://benesse-artsite.jp/en/) which is an "art island" that has these gigantic art installations around the place and has this gigantic room with a Claude Monet painting where the entire point is that they've built a specialized architectural chamber specifically for the viewing of that piece of art.
